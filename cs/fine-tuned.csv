"Within a paragraph, explain the MVC architecture.","The Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture is a software design pattern commonly used in developing web applications. In MVC, the application is divided into three interconnected components: the Model, the View, and the Controller. The Model represents the data and business logic of the application, encapsulating its state and behavior. It communicates with the database, processes data, and responds to requests from the Controller. The View is responsible for presenting the data to the user, providing the interface through which users interact with the application. It receives data from the Model and renders it in a user-friendly format, such as HTML for web applications. The Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View, handling user input and requests, invoking appropriate actions on the Model, and determining which View to display in response. This separation of concerns in MVC promotes modularity, maintainability, and scalability in software development, allowing for easier management and modification of individual components without affecting the overall functionality of the application.","
