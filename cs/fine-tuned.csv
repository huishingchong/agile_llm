"Within a paragraph, explain the MVC architecture.","The Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture is a software design pattern commonly used in developing web applications. In MVC, the application is divided into three interconnected components: the Model, the View, and the Controller. The Model represents the data and business logic of the application, encapsulating its state and behavior. It communicates with the database, processes data, and responds to requests from the Controller. The View is responsible for presenting the data to the user, providing the interface through which users interact with the application. It receives data from the Model and renders it in a user-friendly format, such as HTML for web applications. The Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View, handling user input and requests, invoking appropriate actions on the Model, and determining which View to display in response. This separation of concerns in MVC promotes modularity, maintainability, and scalability in software development, allowing for easier management and modification of individual components without affecting the overall functionality of the application.","
The Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture is a software design pattern that separates an application into three components: the model (data and business logic), the view (user interface), and the controller (that handles user input).

Summarise the difference between internal and external fragmentation.,"Internal fragmentation occurs when allocated memory blocks within a process are larger than necessary, resulting in wasted memory space due to unused portions within the allocated blocks. This typically happens in fixed-size memory allocation schemes where processes are assigned memory blocks that may be larger than the actual size required by the process, leading to inefficient use of memory resources. On the other hand, external fragmentation occurs when there is unallocated memory space scattered throughout the memory, making it difficult to allocate contiguous blocks of memory to processes even though the total free memory space may be sufficient. This fragmentation occurs over time as memory is allocated and deallocated, leaving gaps or holes of various sizes between allocated blocks. External fragmentation can lead to inefficient memory utilization and can be particularly problematic in dynamic memory allocation schemes.","

Briefly explain the concept of the 'lifetime' of a variable,The lifetime of a variable is the period of time in which the variable can be used while the program is running. It is the period of time in which the variable has been allocated a memory address and has not yet been deallocated.,"
In computer science, the 'lifetime' of a variable refers to the duration of its existence in a program. Variables can have different lifetimes depending on their scope and usage. For instance, a variable declared inside a function will only exist until that function is called, whereas a variable declared outside of a function will exist throughout the entire program's execution. Additionally, variables can also have variable lifetimes depending on the data type they are using. For example, a variable declared as an integer will exist throughout the entire program's execution, whereas a variable declared as a floating-point number will exist only as long as the program is running."

What security mechanism restricts how documents or scripts loaded from one origin can interact with resources from another origin in web browsers?,"The same-origin policy is a crucial security measure in web browsers that prevents scripts from one origin from accessing resources from another origin. By enforcing origin integrity, it ensures that scripts loaded from one source cannot interact with resources loaded from a different source. This is essential for safeguarding sensitive data and resources against potential malicious access. Implemented across major browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and Safari, the same-origin policy serves as a foundational security feature, upholding the principle of isolating origins to mitigate security risks.","
The security mechanism used to restrict how documents or scripts loaded from one origin can interact with resources from another origin in web browsers is called the Same Origin Policy (SOP). This policy enforces restrictions on cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) between web origins, which helps protect against malicious attacks. 

The SOP allows resources loaded from the same origin to interact with each other, while blocking resources loaded from other origins to interact with each other. This helps ensure that resources are not misused or abused, and that the integrity of the web application is maintained. 

In a Computer Science educational context, the SOP is an important concept to understand when developing web applications, as it can affect the security and functionality of the application. It is important to follow the SOP when writing code to ensure the application is secure and works properly."
