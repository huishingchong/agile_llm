This inherent transparency and immutability help mitigate the risk of data tampering, fraud, and unauthorized access, thereby strengthening cybersecurity defenses. Additionally, blockchain's use of cryptographic techniques ensures secure authentication, data encryption, and digital signatures, further bolstering the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive information. Furthermore, blockchain enables the development of decentralized identity management systems, where users have control over their digital identities and can securely authenticate themselves without relying on centralized authorities.

They ensure the website is visually appealing, intuitive, and responsive across devices. In contrast, back-end web development deals with the server-side logic, databases, and infrastructure that power the functionality of the website or application. Back-end developers work with languages like Python, Java, or Node.js to handle server operations, process user requests, and manage data. They implement features like user authentication, database interactions, and server-side validation to ensure security and performance.
